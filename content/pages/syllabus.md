Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

No specific classes are required, but the course presupposes mathematical maturity at the level of a first-year math graduate student.

Course Description
------------------

This course examines classical and modern developments in graph theory and additive combinatorics, with a focus on topics and themes that connect the two subjects. The course also introduces students to current research topics and open problems.

A foundational result in additive combinatorics is Roth’s theorem, which says that every subset of {1, 2, …, _n_} without a 3-term arithmetic progression contains _o_(_N_) elements. You will see a couple of different proofs of Roth’s theorem: (1) a graph theoretic approach and (2) Roth’s original Fourier analytic approach. A central idea in both approaches is the dichotomy of structure versus pseudorandomness, and it is one of the key themes of the course.

Topics
------

*   Forbidding subgraphs
*   Szemerédi’s regularity lemma
*   Pseudorandom graphs
*   Graph limits
*   Roth’s theorem
*   Structure of set addition
*   The sum-product problem

Grading
-------

The final grade will be determined by the minimum of the student’s performance in the two categories:

*   Problem sets: 6 problem sets
*   Writing assignments: (1) course notes and (2) Wikipedia contributions

There will be no exams. For borderline grades, participation may play a factor in determining the final grade. In addition, there will be a list of open problems for which any significant progress/resolution may, at the discretion of the instructor, result in a grading bonus, overriding the above grading criteria.
